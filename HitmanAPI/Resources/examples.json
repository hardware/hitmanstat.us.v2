On every occasion, he has managed to come back from the dead. We have confirmation that Faba has a meeting in the Miami Bayside Center to review details on a new target and an informant at the site has provided us with reliable intel on Faba’s expected movement around the Center.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n47, I feel I'm repeating myself a little bit here, but... Please make sure he doesn't come back. Again. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nGood luck.",
